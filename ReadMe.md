## Java 8 Modern Programming
### Why Java 8?
1) Needed Java 8 for functional programming features such as Lambdas, Streams, Optionals etc.
2) Also helps in parallel programming, prior to Java 8 we need to use threads for achieving parallel programming but dealing with threads is tricky and risky.
3) With Java8 we will be able to write the functional programming code using the new functional concepts which is going to help you simplify the concurrency operations which will make use of the multiple processors whenever needed.
4) Supports creating immutable objects, which will help in solving a lot of issues in Java application because of the objects states getting changed.
5) More concise and readable code.
6) In Java 8, with functional programming we can create a function and assign that functionality to a variable and pass it around as like method parameters.
7) With Java 8, we can write the code in declarative way instead of imperative way.

### Imperative vs Declarative ways of programming
**Imperative Style of Programming**
1) Focuses on how to perform the operations. 
2) Embraces Object mutability. 
3) This style of programming lists the step by step of instructions on how
to achieve an objective. 
4) We write the code on what needs to be done in each step. 
5) Imperative style is used with classic Object Oriented Programming.

**Declarative Style of Programming**
1) Focuses on what is the result you want. 
2) Embraces Object immutability. 
3) Analogous to SQL (Structured Query Language). Similar to SQL where we just retrieve data from without bothering about how it is done, functional programming also uses the same idea. Focuses on the result.
4) Use the functions that are already part of the library to achieve an
objective. 
5) Functional Programming uses the concept of declarative programming.

### What is Lambda Expression?
1) Lambda is equivalent to a function (method) without a name. 
2) Lambdas are also referred as Anonymous functions that has.

    • Method parameters

    • Method Body

    • Return Type 

3) Lambdas are not tied to any class like a regular method. 
4) Lambda can also be assigned to variable and passed around.
5) Lambda is mainly used to implement Functional Interfaces (SAM: Single Abstract Method).
